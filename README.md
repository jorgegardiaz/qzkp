# Desiganted Verifyer Quantum Perfect Zero Knowledge Proof based on Conjugate Coding

This repository will contain an implementation of a **zero knowledge** cryptographic protocol in a quantum setting in Rust. The main goal is to demonstrate how to validate information (e.g., a secret bitstring and its basis) without revealing this secret itself, by leveraging quantum states.

## Overview

This project explores a **Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP)** approach within the quantum paradigm (QZKP, Quantum Zero Knowledge Proof). It leverages quantum states to prove the possession of certain information (like a secret bitstring and the basis in which it was encoded) without revealing the actual secret to the verifier.
